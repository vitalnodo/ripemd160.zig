# Ripemd160

An implementation of Ripemd160 with traditional init-update-finish API. Thanks to the zig std library for useful functions, including for testing purposes. To make it more productive it may be necessary to make unrolled loop version. In the distant future it might be worth making a parameterized version to support 128, 256 and 320 bits although 160 is the most used.
